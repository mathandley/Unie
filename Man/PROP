ESC[1mNAMEESC[m    PROP - a proof proposition.
    
ESC[1mDESCRIPTIONESC[m
        Proof propositions can be passed as arguments to UNIE's trans 
        command. They are used to initiate a program transformation that 
        corresponds to an improvement proof.
   
        Supplying a proposition will initialise the global relation
        and transformation goal for that proof.
   
        The global relation G will ensure that the operator of any 
        transformation rule applied during that proof implies G.
   
        The user will be notified when the goal is reached.
