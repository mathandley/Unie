        Focussing on the next let binding:
            
            unie> trans $let { x = 1; y = 2 } in x$
            Information: transformation started.
            let x = 1
                y = 2
            in x
            [1]> left
            ≡ x = 1
            [2]> next
            ≡ y = 2
           
        Focussing on the next case alternative:

            Information: transformation started.
            case xs of 
             (y :: ys) ➞ y
             []        ➞ "error"
            [1]> right
            ≡ (y :: ys) ➞ y
            [2]> next
            ≡ [] ➞ "error"
