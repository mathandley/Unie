        define - uses the term under transformation to define a binding to add 
                 to UNIE's library of definitions. Once added, the new binding 
                 is subsequently unapplied.

SYNOPSIS
        define [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION

OPTIONS
        TERM_SRC_NAME
                Uses the term under transformation as the binding's associated 
                definition and the specified source name as the binding's 
                identifier.
        CVAR    Uses the CVAR's substitution to calculate a context definition
                from the term under transformation. The CVAR's kind prefix
                and identifier are then used in conjunction with this definition 
                to define the context binding.

EXAMPLES

        Defining a term binding:

            unie> trans $\x.x$
            Information: transformation started.
            \x.x
            [1]> define 'foo
            Information: library updated.
            ≡ foo
            [2]> show-lib 'foo
            foo = \x.x

        Defining a context binding:

            unie> trans $\x.x$
            Information: transformation started.
            \x.x
            [1]> define $V_Foo[x]$
            Information: library updated.
            ≡ V_Foo[x]
            [2]> show-lib 'Foo
            V_Foo = \x.[-]

NOTES   
        define is only available when UNIE is in TRANS or TRANSCRIPT mode.
