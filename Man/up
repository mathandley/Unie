EXAMPLES
        
        Focussing on a lambda's body, and then the lambda itself:
            
            unie> trans $\x.x$
            Information: transformation started.
            \x.x
            [1]> right
            ≡ x
            [2]> up
            ≡ \x.x

        Focussing on the right-hand side of a let binding, and then the let
        statement itself:
            
            unie> trans $let { x = 1; y = 2 } in x$
            Information: transformation started.
            let x = 1
                y = 2
            in x
            [1]> left
            ≡ x = 1
            [2]> rhs
            ≡ 1
            [3]> up
            ≡ x = 1
            [4]> up
            let x = 1
                y = 2
            in x
