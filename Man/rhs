            unie> trans $let { x = 1; y = 2 } in x$
            Information: transformation started.
            let x = 1
                y = 2

        Focussing on the right-hand side of a case alternative:

            Information: transformation started.

             (y :: ys) ➞ y
             []        ➞ "error"
